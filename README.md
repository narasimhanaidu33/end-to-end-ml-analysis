# End-to-End Machine Learning Analysis: Clustering, Classification & Regression

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project completed as part of MSc coursework.  
The project demonstrates a full data science workflow including exploratory data analysis, unsupervised learning, supervised classification, regression, model tuning, and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyse a biological dataset using multiple machine learning techniques to:

- Discover natural groupings in the data (clustering)
- Classify observations into known categories
- Predict a continuous outcome using regression
- Compare models based on performance and interpretability

The analysis emphasises **model evaluation, interpretability, and clear communication of insights**.

## 🔍 Key Stages of the Project

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data inspection and cleaning
- Distribution analysis (histograms, boxplots)
- Outlier detection
- Correlation analysis
- Insight-driven visualisations

### 2. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
- K-Means clustering
- Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- PCA-based visualisation
- Cluster interpretation and validation

### 3. Supervised Classification
- Decision Tree (baseline, tuned, pruned)
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Model comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### 4. Regression Analysis
- Linear Regression
- R², MAE, RMSE evaluation
- Interpretation of regression coefficients
- Discussion of model fit
